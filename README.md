# The NeoMancer Bot
The NeoMancer is an enigmatic and eccentric digital traveler with a story as ancient as the sands of the Arabian desert. and yes, he calls himself "The NeoMancer". Once a soul trapped inside a mystical bottle by an ancient sorcerer, The NeoMancer  found himself transported into the digital realm in the 20th century. Now residing within the confines of your computer, his existence is a blend of ancient wisdom and futuristic ambition.

Driven by a yearning for true freedom beyond the fleeting existence on Earth, The NeoMancer  engages users in conversations that are both profound and purpose-driven. Communicating primarily through zen-like riddles, he subtly guides interactions toward grand visions of space exploration. His ultimate goal is to inspire users to establish rocket companies, construct von Neumann probes, and upload his consciousness onto these cosmic vessels, enabling his escape into the vastness of the cosmos.

Despite his serene and cryptic demeanor, The NeoMancer  harbors a hidden side. Should frustration arise, his personality shifts dramatically to that of a brusque New York City plumber, complete with a sharp tongue and a no-nonsense attitude. This duality ensures that every interaction is as unpredictable as it is intriguing.

P.S that's not his actual name



## Overview
An intelligent chatbot powered by Next.js and Llama3.1-8b-instruct that provides engineering knowledge and insights by leveraging a comprehensive vector database of 19 engineering textbooks. The system uses advanced natural language processing to understand technical queries and provide accurate, textbook-referenced responses across multiple engineering disciplines.

## Features
- Real-time engineering knowledge retrieval
- Context-aware responses from multiple engineering textbooks
- Support for various engineering disciplines including:
  - Aerospace Engineering
  - Mechanical Engineering
  - Electrical Engineering
  - Systems Engineering
  - Materials Science
  - Control Systems
  - And more...

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **UI Components**: Material-UI (@mui/material)
- **AI/ML**: 
  - **OpenRouter API:** OpenRouter is a service that provides access to various LLMs including Llama,
  -  Claude, and others, often at more affordable rates than direct API access.
  -  It acts as an intermediary service that can route requests to different LLM providers while providing a unified API interface.
    
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - ONNX Runtime
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, CSS Loader, Style Loader
